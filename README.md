# SocialQuery
SocialQuery: Simplifying interviews with a central query repository. Easily organize, reference, and manage questions across categories for a more efficient and well-prepared interview experience.

## Project Description 
This web application, developed using the MERN stack, is designed to effectively manage and categorize user queries. It offers user authentication and an admin dashboard for content management on the website. Users can create accounts with unique emails, add categories, and store their queries. Furthermore, it features an attractive and innovative UI that helps users navigate and understand the platform better. The application also allows users to add comments under these queries, ensuring they never forget important questions during interviews, code reviews, or development discussions.
