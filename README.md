# 💥 SocialQuery 
SocialQuery: Simplifying interviews with a central query repository. Easily organize, reference, and manage questions across categories for a more efficient and well-prepared interview experience.

# 🔍 Project Description 
This web application, developed using the MERN stack, is designed to effectively manage and categorize user queries. It offers user authentication and an admin dashboard for content management on the website. Users can create accounts with unique emails, add categories, and store their queries. Furthermore, it features an attractive and innovative UI that helps users navigate and understand the platform better. The application also allows users to add comments under these queries, ensuring they never forget important questions during interviews, code reviews, or development discussions.

# 💡 Why did i build this ?
After checking out several open-source query management tools, I couldn't find any that fit the bill. That's what got me started on this project. It's simple but super useful, making it a great way for folks to dive into open source and for me to kick off my journey into full-stack development.

# 🟰 TechStack 
SocialQuery is built using the tech stack :

- [React.js](https://react.dev/) - A Ui library for building Ui Components with ease 🤌
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - a NoSQL database 🎫
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a utility-first CSS framework 💗

# 🛠️ Local Development
This environment is fully on your computer and requires each dependency (for example MongoDB) to be installed and set up, but it gives you the most flexibility for customisation.
